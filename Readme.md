# Guess Number Generated
This is a small python app I made for fun. You pick a min and max. Then guess what the generated int is. When you guess a higher number than the answer, it tells you to pick a smaller number, and if you guess a smaller number than the answer, it tells you to guess higher.

## Getting Started
* Download files and unzip them
* open terminal in directory,

## Running program
open directory these files are in, in the terminal, then 
```
python3 filename.py
```
then enjoy ;)

## Future Work
* In the future i hope to a counter to see how long it takes people to guess
